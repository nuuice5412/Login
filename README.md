This project is a simple Login Authentication System built with Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, and H2 Database.
It demonstrates user authentication, password validation, and secure access control using a lightweight in-memory or file-based database.

The system allows users to:

Log in via a custom /login page built with Thymeleaf

Authenticate credentials stored in the H2 database

Redirect to a protected /home page upon successful login

This project follows standard Spring Boot architecture for easy scalability and serves as a foundational example for secure web applications.
